<h1> Functions</h1>
<p>functions are reusable blocks of code which perform a specific task, in Javascript we declare a function by using the 
function keyword followed by a name and parameters in ()</p>

<p>Functions are one of the core concepts in every programming language. You might also hear them being called "subroutines" or "procedures". They sound complicated, but the concept is actually very simple - functions allow us to reuse code. This means that we write code once and use it many times.

Let's take a real-world example. Imagine how inconvenient it would be if, every time you wanted to go shopping, you had to sit down and build a bicycle from scratch! In the real world, something is constructed once and used many times. It's the same with code too. Imagine that you want to multiply two numbers. It could be inconvenient and time-consuming to write the same code over and over again a * b. It is better to write it once, turn it into a function and then call it whenever you need it. This is a very simple example, normally there would be much more logic and code in our function than just multiplication.

It would be super complicated if a developer had to repeat all that logic each time she/he needs to achieve some task, just as it would be inconvenient to build a bicycle every time we need it. Functions enable us to think about the problem once, create a solution, store the solution in a function and then reuse that solution whenever we come to the same problem. Cool, right? It is a magic word that solves a problem. You come across two numbers, you want to multiply them, you just shout multiply() and bam! Two numbers are multiplied!

Let’s declare such a function and shout that magic word:</p>

<h2>function declarations:</h2>
<p>First use function keyword, then add the name of the function and then add, if needed, parameters in the parenthesis</p>

<h2>a function is declared as follows</h2>

<pre>function functionName(parameters) { code to be executed }

First, we use the function keyword. This is a reserved word in JavaScript. Secondly, we give the function a name and finally, we supply any parameters inside the parentheses. We'll talk more about naming functions and passing parameters in a minute. First, let’s declare a function that says "hello" and let’s name it hello</pre>

<h2>Naming functions</h2>

<p>is a naming convention for functions defining a set of rules for naming functions--- we give our functions meaningful names.</p>

<p>There are specific rules every developer should follow when naming functions. Functions should be named so that they are easily understood by other developers. When you name your function, try to give it a name that everyone will immediately know what that function does. Don’t name it x or a. Nobody will understand its purpose. ALso, resist the urge to use novelty names for functions. It might be tempting to name all of your functions after Avengers characters, but thor() is not usually an intuitive function name. We name functions, like our variables, so that their purpose is immediately evident.

One more thing needs to be said. When you name your function validateEmail(), that function should only validate email. Nothing else. Don’t put other functionality in it. Don’t calculate the mass of Mars in it. The name should describe what the function does. If you want to calculate the mass of Mars put the code in another function called calculateTheMassOfMars() instead.</p>

<h2>parameters</h2>
<p>parameters are the values that functions can accept. they allow us to pass arguments to functions</p>
<p>we activate it by adding comma separated values betwenn the () in a function definition</p>

<pre>function functionName(parameters)

The parameters are the designated placeholder names for values that we wish to pass to the function. We can pass any number of parameters into a function and they are separated with a comma. Inside the function, the parameters act as variables that are initialised with the values we've passed in.

In the below example we define a function that contains just two parameters – a and b</pre>
