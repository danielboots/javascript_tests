<h1> Javascript page 4 - Loops and Iteration</h1>


<h2>The repetition of operations, meaning it runs the code several times, the most common type of loops are the <strong>for</strong> loops and the <strong>while</strong> loops</h2>


<p>Iterations are performed in loops. We are going to explain each loop in the following lessons. You can think of iteration as doing the same step over and over again until a certain condition is met. For example, you can tell the computer to take five steps in one direction until it gets home:

step.forward(5) until home;
This means step.forward(5) is going to repeat over and over again until it gets home.</p>


<pre>step.forward(5) until home;</pre>

<p>for loops </p>

<pre>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {

   code block to be executed

  }</pre>


<p>Don’t worry. It won’t be that abstract when we look at some examples. Let’s say you are very happy today, super happy! You are learning JavaScript from the comfort of your home; things are good, right? And you want to shout ten times how happy you are. Imagine how unhappy you would be if you had to type the same thing all ten times:</p>

<p>That can’t be right. There must be a much easier way to write the same thing ten times. "For" loop to the rescue:</p>

<h2>for loops</h2>

<h2>explained</h2>

<p>dans explaination - above statement is broken into three parts to start the loop, we need the start point, (ie 0) we need amount of the loop or the condition,  ie start at 0 and if variable is less than (<) 10, next we tell the computer what to do, the 
third part, to incrememnt by 1 we just use var++ simple actually... start at 0, the condition and the action</p>

<h2>Starting point</h2>
<p>0 for example </p>
<h2>the condition</h2>
<p>if the variable is less than more than etc </p>
<h2>the instruction </h2>
<p>do this - var++ var-- etc</p>

<h2>for loops and arrays</h2>
<p>iterating throught arrays allows us to run through arrays we can use a for loop to execute a piece of code for every item in an array</p>

<p>The first thing we want to do is create an array that we are going to iterate through. Iteration is going to display all the items in the array:

</p>

<img src="images/arrayfor.png" alt="">

<p>We created an array on the first line and initialised the for loop on the third line. The critical part is in the parentheses of the for loop. After the declaring the variable i, which we assigned zero to, we check whether the var i is less than the overall size of the array sports. How can we check the size of the array? By using length property, remember? Therefore, iteration will go on until i becomes 4. When it becomes 4, iteration will stop because 4 is not less than 4. When iteration ends, the code block in the curly brackets will not be executed.

In the each iteration i is incremented by one which means it is going to be 0,1,2,3. As before we can access items in an array by their index. That means that we can get the first item in our sports array like this:
sports[0]
Instead of 0, we have incrementer which is going to be 0,1,2,3. That means code block in the {} brackets is going to be sports[0], sports[1], sports[2] and sports[3].</p>

<pre>
let sports = ["basketball", "football", "tennis", "chess"];

for (let i = 0; i < sports.length; i++) {
	console.log(sports[i]);
}
</pre>



<h2>challenge - loops and iteration (for loops)</h2>


<p>Loops and Iteration - Required - For Loops:
At this point in your JavaScript journey, you've learned a multitude of somewhat disconnected ideas which have yet to be able to do much on their own. The concept of loops and iteration will bring a lot of those ideas together. 

Consider that you are the social media manager for a company and the company would like a website containing the usernames of all their Twitter followers. It doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to be functional. 

In the code window we've created a list of 200 random usernames and stored it in a variable called usernames, for you to use as a sample. 

Your challenge is to:
Write a for loop that iterates through the usernames and for each username, logs a valid HTML paragraph tag to the console containing the username (e.g. <p>username1</p>).

Requirements:
The output must match exactly and every username must be included. 

Note: Though this is not a requirement, don't forget you can use template literals if you want your code to be modern and elegant!

If you're stuck, the Loops and Iteration lesson - specifically the For Loops and For Loops and Arrays units - will give you everything you need to succeed. Be sure to submit and compare your answer with the model solution (only available to view after you click submit).</p>

<p>this worked using the for - in version of the loop... </p>

<h2>for in loops</h2>
<p>an easier way to iterate through arrays</p>
<p> we can use a for -in loop to easily get the index integer for elements in the array</p>

<p>Just like in our previous lesson, we're going to create an array to iterate through. Run the code below and then keep reading below the code for an explanation of what is going on here:

</p>

<h2>for - let loops</h2>

<img src="images/forlet.png" alt="">

<p>We created an array on the first line and used a different kind of for loop. This is a much simpler way of iterating through an array. This is called a for-in loop because it uses the keywords for and in inside the parentheses.

As before, the variable i contains the index integer of the current element in the array. That means that the code block in the {} brackets is going to be:</p>


<pre>sports[0] in the first iteration
sports[1] in the second iteration
sports[2] in the third iteration
sports[3] in the fourth iteration</pre>

<p>
This time, though, we don't need to worry about supplying the condition (which, last time was: i < sports.length) or the incrementer (which was: i++ in the previous lesson).

for (let i in sports) is easier to remember, and is good if we want to be able to retrieve and work with the index number of each element in an array. As we've seen, we can get the value of each individual element in the sports array using the code sports[i]. But there is an even easier way, which we'll look at in our next lesson.

<h2>while loops</h2>
<p>is a type of loop which runs the same code until a condition is met</p>
<p>we use the keyword while and set teh condition in the (). add code to be executed in the curly brackets {}</p>
<img src="images/whileloop.png" alt="">

<p>see above for example. for loop is for as long as a condition is met. the while encorporates both, while the condition is true run this code, when its false run this code.</p>
<p>A while loop allows us to run code while the condition in the parentheses is true. If it is not true, stop the iteration. Let’s show our happiness again, but this time with the while loop:</p>

<p>working example</p>

<h2>while loop challenge</h2>


<h2>solution

<h2>do while loops</h2>
<p>is a type of loop which runs the same code until a condition is met it has two 
keywords - <strong>do and while</strong></p>

<pre>This loop has two keywords: do and while. do { block code } while (condition);</pre>

<p>The do while loop will run the block of code at least once even though the condition is false. It means that the block of code runs before the condition is checked. The condition comes after the block of code. This loop is used if you want to run the block of code at least once no matter what. The do while loop will stop iteration when the condition is false. I am sure you want to tell everyone again how happy you are. Ten times! So let's do that again, but with a do while loop:</p>

<img src="images/dowhile.png" alt="">

<img src="dowhile2.png" alt="">

<p>We set the variable i to 0 first; then the code block runs “I am happy”. Then in the same code block, i was incremented by 1. Only after that, the condition will be checked (i < 10). So it doesn’t check if 0 is less than 10. Variable i was incremented by one before the condition. The first time iteration came to the condition; i was already 1. When i became 9, code block was executed (“I am happy”), i was incremented by 1, it became 10, ten is not less than 10, the condition was false, and the loop stopped. But notice that if we set the variable i at the beginning of the iteration to any number higher than 10,


<p>in this example the code will run once, it runs fitst then checks the condition, if we set it to while i =4 or 5 or 6 it will still run once!  </p>

<h2>loops and iteration do while loop - solution </h2>
<p>to print out or console log the last username we use the usernames.length property we also add -1 to give us the ability to run the loop</p>

<p>solution</p>

<h2>bonus challenge - general loops and iteration.</h2>

<img src="images/bonusiteration.png" alt="">

<pre>Sure. So, if you have an array:
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; 
You can access the elements by saying:
console.log(arr[0]); // logs 'a'
console.log(arr[1]); // logs 'b'
console.log(arr[2]); // logs 'c'
 We could use this approach to log out every variable in an array, but if our array has 1000 elements in it, then we can't really be writing 1000 console.log statements, one for each element!
So, what we can do is pass a variable as the index. For example:
let i = 2;
console.log(arr[i]); // as i is 2, this statement
                     // evaluates to console.log(arr[2]),
                     // so it will log 'c'
With that in mind, we can use a for loop which will create a variable called i, and increase it by one each time the loop executes.
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
On the first iteration of the loop, the log statement will evaluate to: 
console.log(arr[0]);
then:
console.log(arr[1]);
then:
console.log(arr[2]);
All the way up to:
console.log(arr[999]);
So the for loop and the variable i are used to iterate through each element of the array, and access the value stored within.
</pre>

<h2>Break and continue </h2>

<p>stops the iteration using the <pre>break</pre> keyword</p>

<p>The break keyword stops the iteration no matter what. No matter at which step the iteration is, break keyword will stop the iteration and exit the loop:

</p>
 
 <p>note operators reference:</p>
 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp"></a>

<img src="images/break.png" alt="">

<p>Although the iteration should have gone all the way up to 4, it ended when i was set to 3 because of the break statement.
</p>

<h2>break challenge</h2>
<p>Although the iteration should have gone all the way up to 4, it ended when i was set to 3 because of the break statement.
</p>

<pre>// Write your loop here. Break it after printing 50 to the console:

let i;

for (i=0; i < 60; i++) {

  if (i===51) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(i)
  }
  </pre>


<h2>continue</h2>

<p>a javascript keyword which skips one iteration and moves to the next by using the continue keyword</p>
<p>the continue keyworkd isnt going to stop the whole iteration and exit the loop iut will just skip one iteration and move to the next one</p>

<h2>example </h2>

<img src="images/continue.png" alt="">

<p>Notice that there is no number 3 in the output. When variable i became 3, the iteration was skipped because of the continue keyword in the if statement and the code block did not run.</p>

<h2>continue challenge</h2>
<img src="images/continuechallenge.png" alt="">

<p>what we take from this lesson is that we are only logging odd numbers so we need a way to iterate through the loop, we can check for an odd number by using the % symbol, modulus if i%2 (remainder) ==== is equal too 0 we know its 
an even number so we then continue with the iteration, this will then check the next number, if we get any other number other than 0 we know its an odd, thich then activates the console.log(i)</p>
