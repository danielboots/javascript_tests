		<h1>Welcome to Dans javascript notes</h1>
        <p> This file i will use for my own personal notes regarding Javascript. Im using an external .js file to write the javascript. Remember to Comment out correctly. I can write notes here too. </p>


<h2> What are Variables</h2>
<hr>
<p> Var: A variable is like a box of data, their values can change, or vary! 

for example Dan is doing a programming course, he is looking at the computer, he is 34 years old.

</p>


<p> If we want to 'save' data and assign it to a var for example the number pi, we know its 3.142 etc instead of retypuing it out we can just say.... var  pi = 3.142, after that so far we just use the variable pi instead of the number, it can also change (hence the name VARIABLES.)</p>
<p>A second example would be when your making a calcultator for work, hourly cost can be 20 or 25 or 30 £ per hour. If thats the case just assign hourly_cost =  </p>

<p> Variables are a time saver we assign a value but it can change .</p>


<h2>Examples of Naming Variables</h2>
<hr>

<img src="images/NamingVariables.png" alt="Naming variable">
<p>As we said previously, variable names don’t matter to the computer, but they certainly matter to the developers. It is much more readable if you name your variable totalAmount, rather than X or just a. The developer that comes after you will then know the purpose of this variable. If you name it X, then future developers will have to first read your code and figure out what it does to see variable X in action. If you name it totalAmount, then they will probably guess what this code is going to do. The code will be much more human-readable, and human-friendly code is a quality of good coding. But certain rules need to be followed, that matter to the computer as well. So let’s see what they are about when it comes to JavaScript. Certain keywords are not supposed to be used when naming the variables. These keywords are shown in the image to the left. They should not be used because they are reserved keywords in JavaScript. They have special meaning and that meaning should never be changed:</p>

<h2>camelCasing</h2>
<hr>

<p>Simply a way of naming..... first name of any var lower case any further words start with a capital</p>

<ul>
<li>camelCasingExample1</li>
<li>camelCasingIsEasy</li>
<li>camelCasingForYou</li>
<li>IAMnotCamelCasing</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript Rules when naming Variables</h2>
<hr>
<p>Certain rules should be followed when naming the variables:

The first character can be a letter, underscore or a dollar sign, but subsequent characters can be letters, digits, dollar sign or underscores
Numbers are not allowed as the first character
There should not be any logical or mathematical operator anywhere in the name (/, *, -, +, &&, ||)
There should not be any special symbols: !, @, *, ? etc.
Spaces are not allowed: lower camelCase should be used instead. If you want to name your variable “current slide”, then it should be named currentSlide
</p>


<h2>Example of naming a variable </h2>
<hr>
// Define your variable here:
var quote=("Keep your face always toward the sunshine and shadows will fall behind you.")

// This will log your variable to the console:
console.log(quote);


<h2>JavaScript - arithmetic and numbers</h2>
<hr>
<p>JavaScript represents numbers as whole numeric characters –  47, referred to as an <strong>integer</strong> </p>
<p>Or as a fractional form using decimals ex. 7.417 this is referred to as a <strong>floating point number or float.</strong> </p>


<p>A number is one of the three core types of data used by JavaScript. But before we go on, let’s get some basic terminology in place.</p>
<p>As with most programming languages, a  fundamental concept within JavaScript is an expression. <strong> An <em>expression </em> produces or results in some value.</strong> </p>


<h2> Types of Arithmetic</h2>
<hr>
<p> Notes: In programming we use arithmetic operators - simply put  (+ _ * ) are operators, they operate on values.</p>
<p>for example</p>
<ul>
<li>10 - 10 = 0</li>
<p>  in this example the - sign is the operator and the operands are 10 and  0 the result is the <strong>EXPRESSION</strong> </p>
<li>10 + 10 = 20</li>
<li>10 * 10 = 100</li>
</ul>

<strong>EXPRESSIONS are formed from : Operand (Number etc)... operator (what your doing ie subtraction minusing etc) Operand (Number etc) </strong>

<img src="images/CoreArithmetic2.png" alt="corearithmetic">

<h2>Modulus</h2>
<hr>
<p>the remainder operatur returns the remained left over this is used by the % sign</p>

<p> example </p> 
<ul>
<li>10 % 3; will return 1 </li>
</ul>

<pre> /* The result of this expression 
is not how many time 10 is divided by 3 but
is the remainder left after the division.
If the divisor (on the right) divides evenly into the dividend (on the left)
the answer will always be 0
*/
10 % 3;</pre>

<h2>Exponential</h2>
<hr>
<p> raising the left operand to the power right operand </p>

<p> or to the Power of </p>

<ul>
<li> <pre> 3 ** 3; = 27  or (3x3x3)</pre></li>
</ul>


<h2> Unary operators - more arithmetic </h2>
<hr>
<p> Now let’s look at the remainder of JavaScript’s  standard arithmetic operators.</p>

<h3> Mathematical definitions:</h3>
<hr>
<p> Unary - consisting of or involving a single component or element.
Unary negation of 2 is the integer '-2' </p>

<img src="images/unary.png" alt="">


<h2> Example</h2>
<hr>
<p> See javascript for correct view.</p>

<p> /* 
First "a" variable was set to 5
but then we increased it 
by one. Try changing the two plus
signs into into minus signs and
see what happens 
*/

<strong> javascript </strong>
<pre>

let a = 5;
a++;

console.log(a); 



/*
First we set variable b to
8 and then we used unary 
negation to set the value
for variable c. 
*/
var b = 8;
var c = -b;

console.log(c); </p>

</pre>

<h2>PEDMAS</h2>
<hr>

<ol>
<li>P - Parentheses first</li>
<li>E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)</li>
<li>MD  - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)</li>
<li>AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)</li>

</ol>

<h2>how to remember - Please Excuse My Aunt Sally</h2>
<p>the order of the rules counts</p>

<ul>
<li>do things in Parentheses first</li>
<li>roots powers etc before multiply divide add or subtract</li>
<li>multiply divide before add or subtract</li>
<li>Otherwise go left to right</li>
</ul>

<h3>example</h3>
<pre>console.log((10 + 10) * 20)</pre> 
<p>will output <strong>400</strong></p>



<h2>Floats</h2>
<hr>

<p>Floating point numbers are numbers that are followed by decimal points. JavaScript also treats integers as floating point numbers; the only difference is that, if the number doesn’t have anything after the decimal it will just pretend that the decimal point isn’t there and display the value as a whole number.</p>
<p> Example: 0.4 + 0.1; returns: 0.5</p>

<p>issues with Floating point numbers </p>

<h2>Special value numbers</h2>
<p> JavaScript has some special "types" of numbers reserved for when you get your maths badly wrong!

What if you decided to perform mathematical operations on some text? Everyone knows that you can't divide a "donkey" by 4 (please don't try it). If you try to perform maths on some text (we also call this text a "string"), then JavaScript will tell you that the result is "NaN", which stands for “not a number”. It is a computational mistake. You can’t divide a string by a number or perform any other mathematical operation on strings.

What if you try to divide a number by zero? Computers don't like that! JavaScript will return a number type called Infinity. What if you divide negative numbers by zero? You will get -Infinity.</p>

<h2>NaN - not ya NAN - it just means.... hey this isnt a number.</h2>
<p>You cant divide strings (you can slice) but you cant perform maths on strings.</p>


<h2>Example;</h2>

<pre>/* You can't divide by zero */
console.log(1 / 0);

/* No, not even negative numbers should
be divided by zero */
console.log(-1 / 0);

console.log("How can a string be divided by number?" / 2);</pre>


<h2>This will Output to the console.</h2>
<pre>
Native Browser JavaScript
   
Infinity
-Infinity
NaN
=> undefined
   

</pre>



<h2>Super Large Numbers : big and small </h2>
<hr>

<p>Sometimes, we need to work with very large or very small numbers. Fortunately, JavaScript can help us here.</p>

<p>What if we want to write a massive number like 10000000000 which has ten zeros, for example? Well, it is easy to make a mistake, to miss a zero or add one extra. JavaScript gives us more straightforward ways to write such large numbers by using the letter <strong>e</strong>  followed by the number of zeros we need. We can use the same notation for small numbers too. This is called exponentiation. The exponent is the number following the letter <strong>e</strong> <p>.

<p> So, we could represent one billion (1 followed by 9 zeros) as: <strong>1e9</strong> . Conversely, a nanosecond, which is one billionth of a second, would be represented as 1e-9. Notice we use a minus sign before the exponent for small numbers.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
/* 4 followed by ten zeros */
console.log(4e10);

/* 1 with six leading zeros */
1e-6;

</pre>

<p>will return</p>

<pre>Native Browser JavaScript
   
40000000000
=> 0.000001
   </pre>



<h2>Challenge - return infinity from a float</h2>

<pre>In the Number Types unit, you learned about how JavaScript works with numbers. You also learned about special number types, such as Infinity and NaN

Your challenge is to:
Change the arithmetic in the console.log so that it returns Infinity

Requirements:
Don't just add the word "Infinity", we want you to change the arithmetic so that the result is the special number type, Infinity.</pre>


<h2>CODE</h2>

<pre>// Change the math so that it returns Infinity
console.log(1/0);</pre>

<p> <strong>Explaination</strong> you cant divide 1/0 thus giving <strong>Infinity</strong> </p>


<h2>Number methods - what is it what does it do , how do you use it </h2>
<p>They are actions that can be performed on numbers</p>
<p>They affect the original number in some way</p>

<pre>How do you use it?

Add '.', method name & argument in parenthesis after object:  


<strong>object.nameOfTheMethod(argument); </strong> </pre>


<p>Number methods might all sound confusing, but actually, it is really straightforward. Let’s just say that the methods are things that can do stuff. If you think about human and computer language, they are quite alike. You can think of numbers as nouns and methods as verbs. Verbs do stuff to nouns. Let’s say you have a sentence “Sun is shining”. In JavaScript, it would be <strong>sun.shining()</strong>  where sun is an object and shining is a method. Developers now can say that they called shining on the sun which means that they called the shining method on the sun object. They did something with the sun; they made it shine. So let’s look at some of the methods that are usually performed on numbers.</p>
<p>parseInt() parses a string and returns an integer</p>
<p>parseFloat() takes a string and returns a floating-point number</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>console.log(
Number.parseInt("10"),
Number.parseInt("3.14"),
Number.parseInt("I am not an integer"));

console.log(
Number.parseFloat("10"),
Number.parseFloat("3.14"),
Number.parseFloat("I am not a float"));</pre>

<p>returns</p>
<pre>Native Browser JavaScript
   
10 3 NaN
10 3.14 NaN
=> undefined
   </pre>


<h2>expanded</h2>

<pre>toString() converts a number to a string

toFixed(2) converts a number to a string, but keeping only two decimals

Back in the Floats unit, you may remember that we mentioned that we can encounter issues working with floating-point numbers. These issues are related to precision. So, if you add the numbers 0.1 and 0.2 in JavaScript, you don't get a nice, clean 0.3 as you'd expect. Instead, you get a result like: 0.30000000000000004. If you want to know why this happens, then please read the section at the bottom of this page. If you just want to know how to fix the precision issue, then set the number of decimal places using the toFixed() method, as demonstrated below.</pre>


<h2>precision</h2>

<pre>
console.log(
	2.34345345.toFixed(5), // 5 decimals
	2.33333.toFixed(1), // 1 decimal
	1.1.toFixed(10) // 10 decimals
);

var myNum = 85;
myNum.toString(); // '85'</pre>

<p>will return</p>


<pre>
Native Browser JavaScript
   
2.34345 2.3 1.1000000000
=> '85'
   
</pre>


<h2>isFinite (number)</h2>

<p>isFinite(number) checks if the value in parenthesis is an actual number isInteger(number) checks if the value in parenthesis is an integer isNaN(number) checks if the value in parenthesis is NaN</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
/*
COPY PASTE EACH LINE OF CODE BELOW TO THE ADJACENT NATIVE BROWSER JAVASCRIPT
*/

/* Returns true because it is a real number.*/ 
Number.isFinite(123);
/* Returns false because -Infinity is not an actual number */
Number.isFinite(-Infinity);

/* Returns true because result of 0/0 is NaN  */
Number.isNaN(0 / 0);
/* Returns true because result of "a" * 3 is NaN  */
Number.isNaN("a" * 3);

/* True because 1 is an integer */
Number.isInteger(1);
/* False because banana is not an integer */
Number.isInteger("banana");
</pre>



<h2>More about javascript floating point precision</h2>

<p>To fully understand the problem, we have to understand how computers store numbers internally. JavaScript uses a format called 64-bit binary floating-point. And this format cannot accurately represent numbers like 0.1 or 0.2 at all! So, JavaScript has to round these numbers to be able to store them. It's in this rounding process that the errors creep in.</p>


<h2>But wait! That's stupid!</h2>
<p>Well, it's not stupid. It's just different. For example, our numbering system can't represent certain numbers properly. If you divide 10 by 3, you get 3.33333333, but if you multiply 3.33333333 by 3, you don't get 10. Instead, you get 9.99999999. In other words, we get a rounding error. When we know about it, we can work around it, and it's the same with 64-bit binary floating-point numbers.</p>

<h2>Why not use a different number format then?</h2>
<p>This is a good question. The simplest answer is that this format gives the best performance. It does have some quirks, but it allows the computer to perform calculations faster and in a format that it understands. It's beyond the scope of this course to explain these formats, but feel free to read about the IEEE-754 standard if you want to dive deeper into it.</p>


<h2>Math Object</h2>
<hr>

<p>what is it: helps with mathematical operations - we use it by calling methods on Math object</p>

<h2>Math objects</h2>
<p>Knowing methods, it will become easier to use the syntax for calling methods on Math object.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Math.floor</strong> rounds down the number. 2.1 will be 2 </li>
<li> <strong>Math.ceil</strong> rounds up the number. 1.1 will be 2 </li>
<li> <strong>Math.round</strong> rounds to the nearest integer. It means 1.4 will be 1, but 1.6 will be 2</li>
<li> <strong>Math.trunc</strong> removes the decimal part of the number. 4.5 will be 4 </li>
<li> <strong>Math.sqrt</strong> returns the square root of the number </li>
<li> <strong>Math.cbrt</strong> returns the cube root of the number </li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples in action</h2>

<pre>
console.log(
Math.floor(1.1), // rounds down the number
Math.ceil(1.1), // rounds up the number
Math.round(1.4), // rounds to the nearest integer
Math.trunc(1.1), // removes the decimal part 
Math.sqrt(81), // returns 9 because 9 * 9 is 81
Math.cbrt(64) // returns 4 because 4 * 4 * 4 is 64
)
</pre>

<p>will return</p>
<pre>Native Browser JavaScript
   
1 2 1 1 9 4
=> undefined
   </pre>

<p> more info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math</p>



<h2>Challenge: Number methods </h2>

<pre>
let myStringInt = '10';
let myStringFloat = '1.275';

// Fix this code so that it adds correctly
let result = parseInt(myStringInt) + parseFloat(myStringFloat);

// This will print your results to the console
console.log(result);
</pre>


<h2><Strong>Strings</Strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>a string is txt/// Strings are fundamental in a developer’s life. Wherever there is a textual data, you are going to need to use strings; first name, last name, city, occupation etc. are all going to represented as strings.</p>
<p>we active them by By enclosing a piece of text in quotations </p>


<pre>
/* Whatever we put in quotes become string
These are all strings */

let a = "I am string";
let b = "3"; // If there were no quotes here, it would be a number
let c = "false"; // If there were no quotes here, it would be a boolean
let n = "Alan";
n = b + c;
console.log("My name is " + "Paul");
console.log("My name is " + n);
console.log('Hello World')

</pre>

<h2>Quotations</h2>

<p> <strong>What is it</strong> The different types of quotations that can be used to denote strings in JavaScript</p>
<p> <strong>What does it do?</strong> Denotes the beginning and end of a string</p>
<p> <strong>How do you use it</strong> <pre>Strings can be enclosed in either single ('this is a string') or double quotes ("this is a string")</pre></p>

<p>Use single or double strings as long as you are consistent.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
let singleQuote = 'single quoted string';
let doubleQuote = "double quoted string";

console.log(singleQuote);
console.log(doubleQuote);
</pre>

<p>Results return exactly the same.</p>

<h2>String Challenge</h2>
<p><strong> Note:</strong> Strings are used to represent textual data. Putting quotation marks around anything you type turns it into a string.</p>

<pre>

// Define the variables below to fix the syntax errors

let quote = 'Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.'
let meaningOfLife = '42'
let oneEqualsTwo = 'false'

</pre>


<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p> you can use two types of ' and " so this can allow you to add apostrophe or quotations in to your strings just use the opposites! see below for example</p>


<pre>

// Define the variables below:
let stringWithQuotes = 'Confucius once said, "It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop."'
let stringWithApostrophe = "Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear."

// These lines will log your quotes to the console:
console.log(stringWithQuotes);
console.log(stringWithApostrophe);

</pre>


<h2>String Escaping</h2>

<p>is a special javascript character</p>
<p>allowing us to add a new line into a string</p>
<p>its used by <em>\n</em> </p>

<img src="images/NewlineEscape.png" alt="string escaping">

<p>When working with text, sometimes we may need to create a line-break, separate paragraphs or other pieces of text. We can do this using the newline character (\n). You may also see newlines being created using the carriage return character (\r). In many cases \n and \r are treated as the same by the interpreter, but they are intended to be different. We recommend that you only use \n to create a new line.</p>

<pre>
/* 
Each word will be on a separate line
*/

console.log("What\na\nbeautiful\nday");
</pre>

<p>returns</p>

<pre>
Native Browser JavaScript
   
What
a
beautiful
day
=> undefined
   

</pre>

<h2>Tab Escaping</h2>
<hr>
<p>also a special JavaScript character allowing up to add a tab in a string we simply add <strong>\t</strong> whenever a new tab is required.</p>

<p>metimes we may need to use a tab, or indent, to denote a new paragraph or some piece of information. In this case, we would use \t</p>
<img src="images/newtab.png" alt="tab example">


<h2>template literals</h2>
<p>are a way of formatting strings without the use of escape characters </p>
<p>gives us a literal rep of a sstring, including and new lines or tabs</p>
<p>we use it by putting anything we need in ` ` quotes Bottom left keyboard and everything will be escaped</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgF9-pdTDGs" target="_blank"> <strong>Video Explaining template literals</strong></a>

 
 <img src="images/templit.png" alt="template literals">

 
<h2>String escaping challenge</h2>
<hr>
<p>In the first Strings lesson you learned about the basics of creating strings and how to handle strings with quotation marks in them. However, it could become annoying or tedious to always remember whether to use single or double quotes when they really were meant to be interchangeable when defining strings in JavaScript. </p>

<h3>challenge</h3>
<ol>
<li>Define a variable, haiku, which will output the haiku below when logged to the console</li>
</ol>

<pre>
// Define the haiku variable here:
let haiku = `Power down your brain
Motion will now take over
Ride this inertia` 

// This will log your haiku to the console:
console.log(haiku);
</pre>

<p>by simply using the backtick i was able to just copy and paste the text required instead of using a \n or /t MUCH EASIER</p>


<H2>Bonus Challenge, template literals and tab escaping</H2>

<pre>
// Define the fileTree variable here:
let fileTree= ` `
// This will log the fileTree variable to the console:
console.log(fileTree);
</pre>

<h2>solution</h2>
<pre>
// Define the fileTree variable here:
let fileTree= 'My computer\n\tC:\\\n\t\tDocuments\n\t\tHome\n\t\tPics\n\t\tProgram Files\n\tD:\\\n\t\tBackup'
// This will log the fileTree variable to the console:
console.log(fileTree);
</pre>

<p>easier using template literals.</p>

<h2>String methods</h2>
<p>are actions for strings which can change and manipulate strings</p>
<p>Use name of the method on the string object. Add string methods after the string object –</p>
<pre> <strong>string.nameOfTheMethod();</strong></pre>

<p>Remember from our Number Methods lesson, that a method performs an action. Strings have methods too, and we're going to look at the common ones in this lesson.

We can use the <strong>indexOf()</strong>  method to find the position of a character in the string. Like most programming languages, JavaScript uses zero indexing, which means that the index of characters starts at 0. As you can see from the following example:
</p>
<img src="images/indexing.png" alt="string methods">


<h2>example</h2>
<p>notes: remember we start at zero, and even spaces and punctuation are counted as numbers, be aware!</p>
<img src="images/strings.png" alt="string methods">



<h2>slice </h2>
<p>think of a slice of bread, we can chose which part of the loaf we want, starting again at zero and ending where we want. this is returned by...</p>

<img src="images/slice.png" alt="slice">
<pre>
let myString = "Creativity";
              /*0123456789 */

/* It excluded first character at the zeroth position
and seventh character and everything after it*/
myString.slice(1, 7);
</pre>

<h2>string methods part 2</h2>
<p>changing the case of the string</p>
<pre>
let myString = "I am string";
let lowercasedString = myString.toLowerCase();
let uppercasedString = myString.toUpperCase();

console.log(lowercasedString);
console.log(uppercasedString);

</pre>
<p>and find out the string lengh</p>
<pre>
let myString = "I'm a very cool string";
console.log(myString.length);
</pre>

<p>we can repeat strings </p>

<pre>let myString = "Hello!";

myString.repeat(3);</pre>

<p>for even more string methods visit <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/15-javascript-string-functions/"></a></p>


<h2>string concatenation</h2>
<p> joining character strings end to end, joining two or more strings </p>
<p>we use this by using the + operator on the string the <strong>concat</strong> method or template literals  </p>

<p>how to string concatenation using the + operator.</p>

<pre>
let firstString = "I am ";
let secondString = "in love with Javascript!";
/* Here we are joning firstString and secondString */
let newString = firstString + secondString;

</pre>

<h2>method 2- concat method</h2>

<pre>
let str1 = "Hello ";
let str2 = "there!";
let str3 = " What a beautiful day to learn Javascript concatenation, right?";

/* We added str2 and str3 to str1 by
 using concat method. Try switching 
 order of strings in concat method. 
 For example, put str2 before concat
 keyword and str1 before str3 in parentheses
 and see what happens
  */
str1.concat(str2, str3);

</pre>


<h2>method 3 template literals</h2>
<p>But there is an even better way with ES6. Remember template literals? Well, you can now join two strings by simply putting the name of the strings in the curly brackets preceded by the dollar sign:</p>

<pre>`${firstString + secondString}`</pre>

<h2>example of template literals</h2>
<pre>
let first = "First string";
let second = " Second string";


/* Notice we used
quotes for template literal */
console.log(`Concatenation is joining two strings:
${first + second}.`);
</pre>

<p>returns</p>

<pre>

Native Browser JavaScript
   
Concatenation is joining two strings:
First string Second string.

</pre>

<h2>String interpolation</h2>
<p> is an insertion of values from another object into the current string, it inserts the value of another objects value into the current string</p>
<p>we achieve this by using concatenation or template literals</p>

<p>Back in the old days, when there were no template literals, you could not insert values of new strings into the new one without closing it first. If you wanted to insert something in the middle of the string, you needed to close its first and last part with quotes. And you had to use plus operators:</p>


<h2>old way adding + operators</h2>

<pre>let leftSide = 10;
let rightSide = 20;


/* We inserted values of two strings into a new string. 
Notice the plus operators and how we had to split our main string
into several chunks*/ 
console.log("Left side is equal to " + leftSide + " and right side is equal to " + rightSide);
</pre>

<h2>Nowadays We Can Inject The Values Directly Into Template Literals Using The Same ${TextGoesHere} Syntax That We Used For Concatenation</h2>

<pre>
let leftSide = 10;
let rightSide = 20;


/* We inserted values of two strings into a new string */ 
console.log(`Left side is equal to ${leftSide} and
right side is equal to ${rightSide}.`);

</pre>

<p>returns</p>

<pre>
Left side is equal to 10 and
right side is equal to 20.
</pre>


<h2> String slicing challenge--- Counting the strings</h2>

<pre>

let quote = 'Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.';

// Use the slice() method here to assign words to the 
// conceive, believe and achieve variables:

let conceive = quote.slice(22,30)
let believe = quote.slice(35,42)
let achieve = quote.slice(51,58)


// This will log the three variable you create to the console
console.log(conceive, believe, achieve);
</pre>

<p>my slice test </p>


<pre>
let quote = 'Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.';

// Use the slice() method here to assign words to the 
// conceive, believe and achieve variables:

let conceive = quote.slice(22,30)
let believe = quote.slice(35,42)
let achieve = quote.slice(51,58)
let slicetest = quote.slice(1,2)


// This will log the three variable you create to the console
console.log(conceive, believe, achieve);
console.log(slicetest);

</pre>

<p>returns</p> 
<pre>
Native Browser JavaScript
   
conceive believe achieve
h

</pre>

<p>what i learned here is counting the slices... 0,1 would return W, 1,2 would return H </p>


<h2> <strong>Bonus Challenge</strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>HOLY SHIT!!!</p> 
<pre>
// These variables will be sliced and concatinated
// to form the emailAddress variable:
let fullName = 'Andrew Martin';
let domainName = 'gmail';
let tld = 'com';

// Define the emailAddress variable here.
// Remember to use the slice() and toLowerCase() string methods:
let emailAddress = `${fullName.slice(0,6) .toLowerCase()}.${fullName.slice(7,13).toLowerCase()}@${domainName}.${tld}`

// This will log the emailAddress variable to the console
console.log(emailAddress);
</pre>

<p>returns</p>

<p>notes on this section:</p>

<ul>
<li>break down what you need</li>
<li>follow the simple rules it might look complicated but reading the code from left to right it makes sense.</li>
<li>follow the correct syntax, template literals `` string concatenation its all there to put together!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arrays</h2>
<hr>
<p>Arrays are a data type in javascript you can think of arrays as a list of values,storing multiple values in the same variable. they are not specific to JavaScript</p>

<p>What is an array? Well, you've already learned how to create individual variables, which can be strings, numbers or Boolean true/false values. An array is simply a list of values, which is stored in one variable.

Arrays can be created using literal notation. You can simply declare a new variable and assign the data in the <strong>[] brackets.</strong> The data in brackets can be any data type you want: strings, numbers, booleans and even arrays themselves:</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
let myArray = [1, 2, "banana", "apple"];
console.log(myArray);
</pre>

<p>returns</p> 
<pre>
[ 1, 2, 'banana', 'apple' ]
</pre>

<h2>Array constructor</h2>
<p>Array can be created with the Array() constructor: <strong> <pre> new Array("item1", "item2", "item3"); </pre> </strong> </p>

<p>literal notation is the preferred way of creating arrays ^^ above.</p>



<h2>array indices</h2>
<p>is a position of an item in an array</p>
<p>allowing us to acces data from a specific position</p>
<p>we use it by using the indexing notation for example <strong>myArray[0]</strong> </p>

<h2>array indexing</h2>
<p>An array in the example below has four items. Each item in the array has a position. It is called an index, and it is a number. Items in arrays start at zero, which means that in our example, number 1 will be at position 0, number 2 at position 1, “banana” at 2 and “apple” at 3.</p>

<pre>
let myArray = [1, 2, "banana", "apple"];
console.log(myArray);
</pre>

<p>returns</p>

<pre>
[ 1, 2, 'banana', 'apple' ]
</pre>

<h2>accessing items</h2>
<p>If you want to access an item in the array, you can just add the index number after the brackets. The output will be an item that is positioned at the number given in brackets. For the sake of simplicity we will use the same example:</p>

<h2>accessing the index of arrays</h2>
<p>this is accomplished by using the console.log(newArray.indexof(1)); see below</p>
